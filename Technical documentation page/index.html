            <article>
                <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
                
                <p>Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>

                <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of HTML and provide ample opportunity for you to test out some skills.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Getting started with HTML</b>,
                    Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>What's in the head? Metadata in HTML</b>,
                    The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>HTML text fundamentals</b>,
                    One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Creating hyperlinks</b>,
                    Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link and discusses best practices for links.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Advanced text formatting</b>,
                    There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements here are less well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article, you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Document and website structure</b>,
                    As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", or "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write the HTML to represent this structure.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Debugging HTML</b>,
                    Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help.<br></p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Assessments</b><br>
                    The following assessments will test your understanding of the HTML basics covered in the guides above.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Marking up a letter</b>,
                    We all learn to write a letter sooner or later; it is also a useful example to test out text formatting skills. In this assessment, you'll be given a letter to mark up.<br>
                    <p></p>
                    <b>Structuring a page of content</b>,
                    This assessment tests your ability to use HTML to structure a simple page of content, containing a header, a footer, a navigation menu, main content, and a sidebar.<br></p>

            <header>Getting started with HTML</header>
            <article><p>In this article, we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!</p>
                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
            <p><code>My cat is very grumpy</code></p>
            <p>
                If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:<br><p></p>

                    
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            </p>
            <p><h3>Attributes</h3><br>
                
                Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.
                 <p></p>
                An attribute should have:
                <p></p>
<ul class="main-list-1">
<li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
<li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
<li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
</ul>

            </p>

            <header>What's in the head? Metadata in HTML</header>
            <article>
                <p>The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page &lt;title&gt;, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document). Web browsers use information contained in the head to render the HTML document correctly. In this article we'll cover all of the above and more, in order to give you a good basis for working with markup.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>What is the HTML head?</h3><p></p>
Let's revisit the simple HTML document we covered in the previous article:<p></p>

<code>
    &lt;!doctype html&gt;<br>
    &lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;<br>
    &lt;head&gt;<br>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;<br>
    &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
    &lt;/head&gt;<br>
    &lt;body&gt;<br>
    &lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;<br>
        &lt;/body&gt;<br>
        &lt;/html&gt;<br>
        
</code><br><p></p>
The HTML head is the contents of the &lt;head&gt; element. Unlike the contents of the &lt;body&gt; element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document. In the above example, the head is quite small:<p></p>

<code>
    &lt;head&gt;<br>
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;<br>
    &lt;title&gt;My test page/title&gt;<br>
    &lt;/head&gt;<br>
</code>
                </p>

            <header>HTML text fundamentals</header>
            <article><p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.</p>
            <h3>The basics: headings and paragraphs</h3>
                <p>Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.</p>
            <p>Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.</p>
            <p>There are six heading elements: <code>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6</code>.<br><p></p> Each element represents a different level of content in the document; &lt;h1> represents the main heading, &lt;h2> represents subheadings, &lt;h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.<p></p>

            <h3>Implementing structural hierarchy</h3><br>
                For example, in this story, the &lt;h1> element represents the title of the story, the &lt;h2> elements represent the title of each chapter, and the &lt;h3> elements represent sub-sections of each chapter</p>
                <p>
                    It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:<p>
                    </p>
<ul class="main-list">
<li>Preferably, you should use a single &lt;h1> per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use &lt;h3> elements to represent subheadings, followed by &lt;h2> elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.</li>
        <li>Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.</li>
</ul>

            <header>Creating hyperlinks</header>
            <article><p>Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the Web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link, and discusses link best practices.</p>
<h3>What is a hyperlink?</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address</p>
<p>For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only to multiple news stories, but also different areas of the site (navigation functionality), login/registration pages (user tools), and more.
</p>
<h3>Anatomy of a link</h3>
<p>
    A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.<br>
        <br>
    
    <code>
    &lt;p><br>
      I'm creating a link to <br>
      &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a>.<br>
    &lt;/p><br>
</code><br>

    This gives us the following result:<br><br>
    I'm creating a link to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla homepage.</a></p>

            <article>
<p>There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text, which we didn't get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements described in this article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.</p>
<h3>Description lists</h3>
<p>In HTML text fundamentals, we walked through how to mark up basic lists in HTML, but we didn't mention the third type of list you'll occasionally come across — description lists. The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers. Let's look at an example of a set of terms and definitions:<br><br>
   
  <div class="graybox">soliloquy<br>                                       
    In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings<br>and in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters.)<br> 
    monologue<br> 
    In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and<br>any other characters present.<br> 
    aside<br>
    In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic<br>effect. This is usually a feeling, thought or piece of additional background information<br> </div>
   <br>
    Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types — &lt;dl>; in addition each term is wrapped in a &lt;dt> (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a &lt;dd> (description definition) element.</p>
    <h3>
        Description list example
    </h3>
    <p>Let's finish marking up our example:<br>
  <code><br>
    &lt;dl><br>
    &lt;dt>soliloquy&lt;/dt><br>
    &lt;dd><br>
          In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner<br>
          thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but<br>
          not to other characters.)<br>
          &lt;/dd><br>
          &lt;dt>monologue&lt;/dt><br>
          &lt;dd><br>
          In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them<br>
          with the audience and any other characters present.<br>
          &lt;/dd><br>
          &lt;dt>aside&lt;/dt><br>
          &lt;dd><br>
          In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for<br>
          humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of<br>
          additional background information.<br>
          &lt;/dd><br>
          &lt;/dl><br>
  </code>
    </p>
    <p>The browser default styles will display description lists with the descriptions indented somewhat from the terms.</p>
    <p><div class="graybox"> 
        <dt>soliloquy</dt>
<dd>In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings and 
in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters.)</dd>
<dt>monologue</dt>
<dd>In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and any other characters present.</dd>
<dt>aside</dt>
<dd>In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramaticeffect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of additional background information.</dd>

            <header>Document and website structure</header>
            <article>
           <p>In addition to defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML also boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure.</p>
           <p>Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:</p>


           <dt><b>header:</b></dt>
            <dd>Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.</dd>

            <dt><b>navigation bar:</b></dt>
            <dd>Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.</dd>
            
            <dt><b>main content:</b></dt>
            <dd>A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!</dd>
            
            <dt><b>sidebar:</b></dt>
            <dd>Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.</dd>
            
            <dt><b>footer:</b></dt>
            <dd>A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.</dd>
            
           <p>A <i>"typical website"</i> could be structured something like this:</p>

            <article><p>Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help you find and fix errors in HTML.</p><br>
<h2>Debugging isn't scary</h2>
<p>When writing code of some kind, everything is usually fine, until that dreaded moment when an error occurs — you've done something wrong, so your code doesn't work — either not at all, or not quite how you wanted it to. For example, the following shows an error reported when trying to compile a simple program written in the Rust language.</p>
<img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Debugging_HTML/error-message.png" alt="debug-example-1">
<p>Here, the error message is relatively easy to understand — "unterminated double quote string". If you look at the listing, you can probably see how println!(Hello, world!"); might logically be missing a double quote. However, error messages can quickly get more complicated and less easy to interpret as programs get bigger, and even simple cases can look a little intimidating to someone who doesn't know anything about Rust.<br><br>

    Debugging doesn't have to be scary though — the key to being comfortable with writing and debugging any programming language or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools.</p><br>
    <h3>HTML and debugging</h3>
    <p>HTML is not as complicated to understand as Rust. HTML is not compiled into a different form before the browser parses it and shows the result (it is interpreted, not compiled). And HTML's element syntax is arguably a lot easier to understand than a "real programming language" like Rust, JavaScript, or Python. The way that browsers parse HTML is a lot more permissive than how programming languages are run, which is both a good and a bad thing.</p>

            <article><p>We've looked at a lot of text so far in this course, but the web would be really boring only using text. Let's start looking at how to make the web come alive with more interesting content! This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire webpages.</p>
        <p>
            This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the fundamentals of embedding multimedia on webpages.<br><br>

<dt><b>Images in HTML</b></dt>
<dd>There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble <img> element used to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in more depth, including basics, annotating it with captions using &lt;figure>, and how it relates to CSS background images.</dd>

<dt><b>Video and audio content</b></dt>
<dd>Next, we'll look at how to use the HTML &lt;video> and &lt;audio> elements to embed video and audio on our pages, including basics, providing access to different file formats to different browsers, adding captions and subtitles, and how to add fallbacks for older browsers.</dd>

<dt><b>From &lt;object> to &lt;iframe> — other embedding technologies</b></dt>
    <dd>At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at a couple of elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the &lt;iframe>, &lt;embed> and &lt;object> elements. &lt;iframe>s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed external resources such as PDF files.</dd>

            <header>Images in HTML</header>
            <article><p>In the beginning, the Web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble &lt;img> element, used to embed a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in depth, including the basics, annotating it with captions using &lt;figure>, and detailing how it relates to CSS background images.</p>
                <h2>How do we put an image on a webpage?</h2>
                <p>In order to put a simple image on a web page, we use the &lt;img> element. This is a void element (meaning, it cannot have any child content and cannot have an end tag) that requires two attributes to be useful: src and alt. The src attribute contains a URL pointing to the image you want to embed in the page. As with the href attribute for &lt;a> elements, the src attribute can be a relative URL or an absolute URL. Without a src attribute, an img element has no image to load.<br><br>
                    
                    The alt attribute is described below.<br><br>
                    So for example, if your image is called dinosaur.jpg, and it sits in the same directory as your HTML page, you could embed the image like so:</p><br>
                    
                    <code>&lt;img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" /></code><br>
                    <p><br>If the image was in an images subdirectory, which was inside the same directory as the HTML page, then you'd embed it like this:</p><br>
                    <code>&lt;img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" /></code><br>

                    <p><br>And so on. You could also embed the image using its absolute URL, for example:</p><br>
                    <code>&lt;img src="https://www.example.com/images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" /></code><br>
                    <p><br>Linking via absolute URLs is not recommended, however. You should host the images you want to use on your site, which in simple setups means keeping the images for your website on the same server as your HTML. In addition, it is more efficient to use relative URLs than absolute URLs in terms of maintenance (when you move your site to a different domain, you won't need to update all your URLs to include the new domain). In more advanced setups, you might use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to deliver your images.<br><br>

                        If you did not create the images, you should make sure you have the permission to use them under the conditions of the license they are published under </p>
                        <p class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> Never point the src attribute at an image hosted on someone else's website without permission. This is called "hotlinking". It is considered unethical, since someone else would be paying the bandwidth costs for delivering the image when someone visits your page. It also leaves you with no control over the image being removed or replaced with something embarrassing.</p><p></p>
                        <h3>Alternative text</h3>
                        <p>The next attribute we'll look at is alt. Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection.

            <header>Video and audio content</header>
            <article>
                <p>Now that we are comfortable with adding simple images to a webpage, the next step is to start adding video and audio players to your HTML documents! In this article we'll look at doing just that with the &lt;video> and &lt;audio> elements; we'll then finish off by looking at how to add captions/subtitles to your videos.</p>
                <p>The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions &lt;video> and &lt;audio> elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them. We'll not be looking at JavaScript here — just the basic foundations that can be achieved with HTML.</p>
                <h3>The &lt;video> element</h3>
                <p>The &lt;video> element allows you to embed a video very easily. A really simple example looks like this:</p>
                <code><br>
                    &lt;video src="rabbit320.webm" controls><br>
                    &lt;p><br>
                          Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a<br>
                          &lt;a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.<br>
                          &lt;/p><br>
                          &lt;/video><br>
                </code><br>
                <p>The features of note are:<br>

                    <dt><b>src</b></dt>
                    <dd>In the same way as for the &lt;img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><b>controls</b></dt>
                    <dd>Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><b>The paragraph inside the &lt;video> tags</b></dt>
                        <dd>This is called fallback content — this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the &lt;video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.</dd><br>
                    
                    The embedded video will look something like this:</p>

            <header>From object to iframe — other embedding technologies</header>
            <article><p>By now you should really be getting the hang of embedding things into your web pages, including images, video and audio. At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at some elements that allow you to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the &lt;iframe>, &lt;embed> and &lt;object> elements. &lt;iframe>s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed external resources such as PDF files.</p>
                <h3>A short history of embedding</h3>
                <p>
                    A long time ago on the Web, it was popular to use frames to create websites — small parts of a website stored in individual HTML pages. These were embedded in a master document called a frameset, which allowed you to specify the area on the screen that each frame filled, rather like sizing the columns and rows of a table. These were considered the height of coolness in the mid to late 90s, and there was evidence that having a webpage split up into smaller chunks like this was better for download speeds — especially noticeable with network connections being so slow back then. They did however have many problems, which far outweighed any positives as network speeds got faster, so you don't see them being used anymore.<br><br>
                    
                    A little while later (late 90s, early 2000s), plugin technologies became very popular, such as Java Applets and Flash — these allowed web developers to embed rich content into webpages such as videos and animations, which just weren't available through HTML alone. Embedding these technologies was achieved through elements like &lt;object>, and the lesser-used &lt;embed>, and they were very useful at the time. They have since fallen out of fashion due to many problems, including accessibility, security, file size, and more. These days major browsers have stopped supporting plugins such as Flash.<br><br>
                    
                    Finally, the &lt;iframe> element appeared (along with other ways of embedding content, such as &lt;canvas>, &lt;video>, etc.) This provides a way to embed an entire web document inside another one, as if it were an &lt;img> or other such element, and is used regularly today.<br><br></p>
